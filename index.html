        <p>
          I am Thomas, a web development enthusiast with a passion for technology. I am currently honing my skills at Le Wagon, where I am learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Ruby for back-end development. My ultimate goal is to become a well-rounded web developer and make a positive impact in the tech industry. My love for problem-solving and creativity drives me in this field.

          Aside from web development, I am also an avid sports fan and enjoy playing and watching various sports in my free time. I believe that participating in sports helps me stay physically and mentally active, and the teamwork and competition taught in sports can also be applied to my work in web development. I am always looking for opportunities to improve both in my career and my personal life, and sports play a big role in helping me achieve this balance.
